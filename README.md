# Scoreboard Challenge: Client Side

Steps to start:

+ Download the git.
+ Use `npm install` or `yarn install`
+ To start in development mode you can do: `npm dev` or `yarn dev`
+ To use production mode: first: `npm or yarn build`, then `npm or yarn start` (It is faster)
+ Both development or production url are: `http://localhost:3000`

**Backend server configuration**

By default the backend server will start at `https://localhost:5001` but if you want to change, then you can go to `utils -> server.config.js` and just change the url.
